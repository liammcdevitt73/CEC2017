#CEC2017 (Java Implementation)
Java implementation of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017 benchmark functions.

This benchmark suite provides 29 challenging boundary-constrained real-valued minimization problems with various landscape characteristics.

Problems include: uni-modal, multi-modal, hybrid, composite, shifted, noisy, separable, and non-separable functions.

Function definitions match those given in the technical report:

N. H. Awad, M. Z. Ali, P. N. Suganthan, J. J. Liang, and B. Y. Qu, “Problem definitions and evaluation criteria for the cec 2017 special session and competition on single objective real-parameter numerical optimization,” 2016.

Java function implementations are based on C++ from https://github.com/P-N-Suganthan/CEC2017-BoundContrained by Dr. P. N. Suganthan.

Functions in this implementation version are intended to be optimized in 30 dimensions. Other dimensional sizes were not tested.
